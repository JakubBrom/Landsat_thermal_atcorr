# Landsat_thermal_atcorr
Atmospheric correction for Landsat thermal data according to Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino - QGIS script
Script is usable for Landsat data before 2000. For newer data see https://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov 

## Istallation

You need QGIS, version 2.x and active Processing toolbox. Copy script files into the Scripts folder (see Processing/Options/Scripts/Scripts folder). It is also possible installing script from Processing tools panel: Scripts/Tools/Add script from file. The second way is easier however only script without help is installed.
